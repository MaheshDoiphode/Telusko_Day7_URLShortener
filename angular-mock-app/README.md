# Angular Shorten URL App

Sure! Here's an explanation of the flow of the URL Shortener project, written in simple and beginner-friendly language:

1. To run the project, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from the Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).

2. After downloading the project from the GitHub repository, follow these steps:

   a) Open a special window on your computer called "terminal" or "command prompt".
   
   b) Go to the folder where you want to keep the project by typing `cd <folder-path>`. Replace `<folder-path>` with the actual location of the folder on your computer.

   c) Install all the necessary parts of the project by typing `npm install`. This will make sure everything is set up correctly.

   d) Build the project by typing `ng build`. It will compile all the code and prepare it for running.

   e) Finally, serve the project by typing `ng serve`. This will start a local server so you can see and interact with the project in your web browser.

3. Now, let's understand how the project works:

   a) When you open the website, you will see a form where you can enter a long URL that you want to shorten. It's like a magic wand to make your URL shorter and easier to share!

   b) When you click the "Shorten URL" button, the website will talk to a special part called the backend. This backend is like the brain of our project.

   c) The backend will generate a unique, short URL for your long URL. It's like giving your long URL a special nickname.

   d) The backend will also remember the connection between the long URL and the short URL. It's like keeping a secret list so we can remember the original URL later.

   e) Once the backend generates the short URL, it will send it back to the website. You will see the short URL displayed on the screen, ready to be copied and shared!

   f) When someone clicks on the short URL, the website will know and redirect them to the original long URL. It's like a secret code that unlocks the original URL.

That's it! You now have a URL Shortener project up and running. It's like having a magical tool to make your URLs shorter and easier to handle. Enjoy using it and sharing your shortened URLs with others!
